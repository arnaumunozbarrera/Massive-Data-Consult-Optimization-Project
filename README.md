# Massive Data  & Consult Optimization for an Oracle DB
### Autor: 
Arnau MuÃ±oz Barrera

## Introduction
In this project I work on the mass import of data in Oracle using Python, managing them and evaluate the impact of indexes on the execution of queries. 
For data import that I needed to complete the notebook [insertData](src/insertData.ipynb) I used this repository, that contains datasets of different types and characteristics that are used to evaluate computational learning methods. For data management, 
the Python [script](src/testUCI.py), and to perform the specified experiment and save the results obtained in the database. 

Finally, with the entire volume of data generated, the impact of the indexes on the queries to be made was evaluated in the inform.

### Prerequisites
- Scripts Python: Code of this repository. 
- Example data of UCI: Iris, Ionosphere, Breast Cancer, Letter Recognition. Can get them through the python package of UIC (ucimlrepo).
- SQLDeveloper, VS Code (IDE to code using Python).
